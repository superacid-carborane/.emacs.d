1 About this Repo
═════════════════

  This repo contains my [emacs] configuration files. I try to keep
  things simple and logically organized. Emacs is so customizable that I
  think that the best thing to do is to use repos like this for
  inspiration but ultimately your own configuration will depend on what
  you are doing. If you are new to emacs, rather than finding some
  random .emacs.d on the internet, I would suggest using "stock" emacs
  and then figuring out what you hate about it and then start your own
  .emacs.d repo to fix the things that you hate.

  Most of the structure of this configuration is +stole-from+ inspired
  by the [emacs config] from the wonderful book [Clojure for the Brave
  and True].

2 init.el
═════════

  All the magic happens here. This is the file that is read when emacs
  first starts. There are two main sections.


2.1 Packages
────────────

  This is where we define which package repositiories we want to use for
  plugins. I prefer [mepla]. There is also a section for loading any
  arbitrary `.el' file from the `/vendor' fodler.


  [mepla] https://melpa.org


2.2 Customizations
──────────────────

  All customizations are located in the `/customizations' folder. I try
  to split things up in a logical fashion.
