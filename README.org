#+TITLE: Lev's Emacs Config 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Personally, I feel inspired whenever I open Emacs. Like a craftsman entering his workshop, I feel a realm of possibility open before me. I feel the comfort of an environment that has evolved over time to fit me perfectly â€“ an assortment of packages and keybindings which help me bring ideas to life day after day.

* About this Repo
This repo contains my [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] configuration files. I try to keep things simple and logically organized. Emacs is so customizable that I think that the best thing to do is to use repos like this for inspiration but ultimately your own configuration will depend on what you are doing. If you are new to emacs, rather than finding some random .emacs.d on the internet, I would suggest using "stock" emacs and then figuring out what you hate about it and then start your own .emacs.d repo to fix the things that you hate. 

Most of the structure of this configuration is +stolen from+ inspired by the [[https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure][emacs config]] from the wonderful book [[http://www.braveclojure.com/][Clojure for the Brave and True]].

* init.el 

All the magic happens here. This is the file that is read when emacs first starts. There are two main sections. 

** Packages
This is where we define which package repositiories we want to use for plugins. I prefer [[https://melpa.org][mepla]]. There is also a section for loading any arbitrary ~.el~ file from the ~/vendor~ fodler.

** Customizations
All customizations are located in the ~/customizations~ folder. I try to split things up in a logical fashion.
